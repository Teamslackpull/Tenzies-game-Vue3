My Dice Game Application

Overview

I created a Dice Game application using both Vue 3 and React.
Through this experience, I discovered that I really enjoy working with Vue 3.
It’s straightforward and intuitive, making development a pleasure.

Purpose

The purpose of this was to compare the development experience between Vue 3 and React.
I plan to continue creating applications in both frameworks until I finish my course at Scrimba
so i have the skills to make a good decision.

Future Plans

Once I complete the Quizical Soloproject,
I will move on to an advanced module of React that’s ready for me when I finish the Quizzical app quiz.

Technologies Used

	•	Vue 3: For its straightforward and clean design.
	•	React: To leverage its powerful ecosystem and advanced features.
